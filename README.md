# apollo-backend (self-hosting fork)

A self-hostable fork of [`christianselig/apollo-backend`](https://github.com/christianselig/apollo-backend), the archived Go service that powered push notifications, inbox checks, and subreddit/user watchers for the original [Apollo for Reddit](https://apolloapp.io/) iOS app.

<p align="center"><em>Reddit push notifications, back on a sideloaded Apollo — delivered entirely by your own server.</em></p>

This fork is meant to be run together with **[Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn)** — the iOS tweak that lets sideloaded Apollo builds use the user's own Reddit OAuth credentials. The tweak's **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend** URL field points at an instance of this fork; with that wired up, push notifications and watchers come back to life for sideloads that have a real APNs entitlement.

Single-tenant by design: one deployment serves one sideloaded Apollo build (one bundle ID, one Apple Developer team), and can be shared with a small group of friends running the same build.

> [!TIP]
> **New to self-hosting this?** Start with a step-by-step Getting Started guide — there's one per delivery path: **[native APNs](GETTING_STARTED.md)** (paid Apple Developer account, full fidelity including Live Activities) or **[Bark](GETTING_STARTED_BARK.md)** (completely free, no Apple Developer account, works on free-Apple-ID sideloads). Each walks you all the way from installing Docker to a test notification landing on your phone. Want free hosting too? See **[running it on Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier](ORACLE_CLOUD.md)**. This README is the technical reference; those guides are the on-ramp.

## Before you start

Three hard prerequisites — none of these are negotiable, and skipping any of them produces failure modes that look like backend bugs but aren't:

1. **A paid Apple Developer account — or Bark delivery.** APNs delivery requires the `aps-environment` entitlement, which Apple only grants under a paid team ($99/yr). Free-account sideloads can register devices and exercise every endpoint, but APNs pushes never arrive. As of the Bark transport (see [What changed from upstream](#what-changed-from-upstream)), free-account sideloads can instead receive notifications through the free [Bark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bark-custom-notifications/id1403753865) App Store app: the tweak registers the device with `transport: bark` and the backend POSTs each notification to the device's Bark push URL, with an `apollo://` deep link that opens Apollo when tapped. Prerequisites 2–3 below still apply to APNs devices only.
2. **A custom bundle ID — *not* `com.christianselig.Apollo`.** Reddit's edge WAF has the original Apollo bundle ID on its blocklist; any request whose `User-Agent` contains that string gets a 403 HTML "blocked by network security" response from `oauth.reddit.com` and the token endpoint. Re-sign your sideloaded build under your own bundle ID (e.g. `com.you.Leto`) and use that everywhere — `APPLE_APNS_TOPIC`, the App ID's Push entitlement, the tweak's User Agent.
3. **An explicit App ID with Push Notifications enabled** at developer.apple.com — not Sideloadly's wildcard. Push capability isn't enabled on wildcard provisioning profiles, so the entitlement is silently absent and Apple drops every notification.

## What changed from upstream

The upstream backend was deeply tied to Christian's App Store deployment. This fork strips or reworks every assumption that depended on it.

- **Stripped entirely**: App Store IAP / Apollo Ultra receipt validation (the `internal/itunes/` package and its device-deletion side effect on receipt failure), the `/v1/contact` endpoint, Bugsnag, Heroku's hmetrics auto-emitter, and `render.yaml`.
- **Live Activities restored** (after being stripped along with the above). Apollo's "follow this thread" Dynamic Island / Lock Screen activity registers via `POST /v1/live_activities`; a dedicated worker polls the thread every 30 seconds for ~75 minutes and pushes comment-count/score/newest-comment updates over APNs `liveactivity` pushes. The push topic is derived from `APPLE_APNS_TOPIC` (`<bundle-id>.push-type.liveactivity`), the gateway follows `APPLE_APNS_SANDBOX`, and the endpoint sits behind `REGISTRATION_SECRET` (needs a tweak build that sends the registration token on this path). Reddit credentials come from the registered account row, so the account must be registered (open Apollo with the backend configured) before starting an activity. When the registration carries `X-Apollo-Live-Activity-Avatars: 1` (the tweak sends it while **Show User Profile Pictures** is on), each push also embeds the newest comment author's profile picture as `commentAuthorAvatar`, a base64 48×48 JPEG of about 1.5 KB: a Live Activity has no network access, so the image has to ride in the push. The worker looks the picture up with `/user/<name>/about` on the account's own token, downloads it only from Reddit's image hosts, and caches the result per author in the locks Redis (24 h, 6 h for users without one). Comment text is capped at 500 characters, and trimmed further when needed, so every payload stays under APNs' 4 KB `liveactivity` limit. Before the cap, one long comment made APNs refuse the push, which deleted the activity.
- **APNs topic configurable** via `APPLE_APNS_TOPIC` — formerly hardcoded.
- **APNs gateway configurable** via `APPLE_APNS_SANDBOX`. Apollo's release-signed binary always sent `sandbox=false` (it was App Store production); sideloaded builds signed under a dev cert need sandbox APNs, and pinning this per deployment avoids `BadDeviceToken` errors and the worker's aggressive auto-delete on receipt of one. The notifications worker now picks its APNs gateway from `device.Sandbox` per-device, rather than the now-vestigial `account.Development` flag.
- **Reddit OAuth credentials are per-account**, stored on `accounts.reddit_client_id` / `reddit_client_secret` / `reddit_redirect_uri` / `reddit_user_agent`. Installed-app credentials (empty `client_secret`) are accepted. If the tweak doesn't manage to inject them on a given registration (it can't reach bodies attached to upload-tasks), the API falls back to `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` / `REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI` / `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` env vars on the API process.
- **CamelCase registration payloads accepted.** Apollo's iOS client posts `accessToken` / `refreshToken`, not the snake_case shape upstream documented. The handler accepts both.
- **Bark transport for free-account sideloads.** `POST /v1/device` accepts two new optional fields: `transport` (`apns`, the default, or `bark`) and `transport_endpoint` (the device's Bark push URL, e.g. `https://api.day.app/<device_key>` or a self-hosted [bark-server](https://github.com/Finb/bark-server)). The same values are also accepted as `X-Apollo-Transport` / `X-Apollo-Transport-Endpoint` headers, which win over the body — the tweak sends headers because Apollo posts `/v1/device` as an upload task whose body the request rewrite can't always reach. Bark devices carry a tweak-generated synthetic 64-hex token in place of an APNs token; every send site (`internal/push`) routes per-device, translating the APNs payload into a Bark JSON POST whose `url` field deep-links back into Apollo (`apollo://reddit.com/r/<sub>/comments/<post_id>` for anything with a post, `apollo://reborn/inbox` for private messages). Three things to know: the Bark push URL is a **bearer capability** — anyone with DB access can push to that phone; notification content transits the Bark relay (api.day.app or your bark-server) plus Apple's push infrastructure **in plaintext** — self-host bark-server if that matters to you; and the push URL is a registrant-supplied address the workers POST to, so on an open-registration deployment it's an **SSRF vector** toward anything the workers can reach (the sender refuses to follow redirects, but set `REGISTRATION_SECRET` before exposing the API to untrusted networks). Bark delivery failures are logged (`bark.notification.errors` in statsd) but never delete the device row, unlike APNs rejections. Live Activities remain APNs-only.

  A self-hosted [bark-server](https://github.com/Finb/bark-server) ships in `docker-compose.yml` behind the opt-in `bark` profile:

  ```bash
  docker compose --profile bark up -d --build
  ```

  A Bark-only deployment needs no Apple credentials at all: leave every `APPLE_*` var empty and the services start with APNs disabled — Bark devices work normally, APNs device registrations and Live Activity registrations are rejected with a 422, and any leftover APNs-destined send logs an error instead of delivering.

  It listens on port 8080 (`BARK_SERVER_PORT` to change) and stores device registrations in the `barkdata` volume. Point the Bark iOS app at it (add server → `http://<host>:8080` or your reverse-proxied HTTPS URL); the app registers itself and shows a device key, and the Bark Push URL for Apollo's settings is `<server>/<device_key>`. That URL must be reachable **from the worker containers** — use a LAN IP or public hostname, never `localhost`. Delivery to the phone still rides Apple's push infrastructure via Bark's own certificate baked into bark-server, so no Apple Developer account is involved. Self-hosting keeps notification content off api.day.app, at the cost of exposing one more port; the hosted api.day.app works fine too if you'd rather not.

  Bark notifications carry Apollo's iconography instead of Bark's: pushes with a post thumbnail show the thumbnail, and everything else (PMs, comment replies) falls back to Apollo's app icon, hosted in the [Apollo-Reborn repo](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/tree/main/assets/bark-icons) (`BARK_DEFAULT_ICON` env var overrides the fallback URL). When the user has picked an alternate app icon in Apollo, the tweak pins that icon's PNG via an `?icon=` query parameter on the registered push URL — bark-server gives query parameters priority over the JSON body, so their chosen icon shows on every notification, thumbnails included.

  Apollo's notification sounds can come along too, with one manual step. Native pushes always say `sound=traloop.wav` and Apollo's bundled notification service extension swaps in the sound picked in-app — that extension never runs for Bark deliveries, and the Bark app can only play its own built-ins or `.caf` files imported into it. The backend forwards the payload's sound name (`traloop`), and the tweak pins the in-app pick via `?sound=` on the push URL; to actually hear them, import the matching `.caf` from [Apollo-Reborn's assets/bark-sounds](https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/tree/main/assets/bark-sounds) into the Bark app — Service tab → the "Alert Sound" card → "Click here to view all available sounds." → **Upload Sound** (files are named by Apollo's internal sound ids, e.g. `diabolicalDoorbell.caf`). Sounds that aren't imported fall back to the default iOS alert tone, so skipping this step breaks nothing.
- **Registration endpoints gated** by the optional `REGISTRATION_SECRET` env var.
- **StatsD is optional** — a `NoOpClient` is wired in when `STATSD_URL` is unset (formerly crashed at startup).
- **Diagnostic stubs for Apollo's three legacy hosts**: `/api/req_v2`, `/api/announcement`, `/v1/receipt[/{apns}]`. Returns permissive responses so the tweak's host-rewrite doesn't strand the client on dead endpoints. The receipt stub hardcodes Pro + Ultra as owned.
- **JWT-format access tokens supported.** Token columns widened from `varchar(64)` to `text` — Reddit switched to JWTs (~1100 chars) sometime after the original backend was archived.
- **Reddit edge WAF workarounds.** `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is now set explicitly on the OAuth token POST (Go's `http.NewRequest` doesn't auto-set it), and `?raw_json=1` is scoped to `oauth.reddit.com/*` calls only (it triggers a 403 HTML block when sent to `www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token`).
- **Dockerized** — `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` replace the original Render-specific deployment.

The result: the backend boots end-to-end with only Postgres, Redis, and either an APNs auth key + bundle ID or a Bark push URL per device. Everything else is opt-in.

## Quickstart with Docker

Requires Docker. An APNs auth key (`.p8`) from a paid Apple Developer account enables direct APNs delivery; without one, run in **Bark-only mode** (leave every `APPLE_*` var empty and use the `bark` profile — see the Bark transport section above).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apollo-Reborn/apollo-backend
cd apollo-backend

# 1. Drop your APNs key (skip for Bark-only mode)
mkdir -p secrets
cp ~/Downloads/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 secrets/apple.p8

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
$EDITOR .env.docker   # APNs: fill in APPLE_KEY_PATH, APPLE_KEY_ID, APPLE_TEAM_ID,
                      #   APPLE_APNS_TOPIC, APPLE_APNS_SANDBOX
                      # Bark-only: leave all APPLE_* empty
                      # Both: REDDIT_* fallbacks, REGISTRATION_SECRET

# 3. Bring it up
make docker-up               # or: docker compose --profile bark up -d --build
make docker-logs             # follow output until health check passes
```

Verify the API is reachable:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/health
# {"status":"available"}
```

You should now be able to point the tweak at `http://<your-host>:4000` (or your reverse-proxied HTTPS URL) and hit **Test Connection**.

## Required environment variables

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_URL` | Postgres URL (via PgBouncer in transaction mode). **No query string** — `cmdutil.NewDatabasePool` appends `?pool_max_conns=…` and a second `?` makes pgx reject the URL. |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_URL` | Redis backing rmq job queues. Configure `noeviction`. |
| `REDIS_LOCKS_URL` | Redis backing the dedup locks (Lua script in `scheduler.go`). Can be the same instance as the queue Redis. |

### Required for APNs delivery (all-or-nothing)

Set **all four** to deliver over APNs, or leave **all four** empty to run in Bark-only mode (APNs disabled; APNs device registrations and Live Activities are rejected with a 422). Setting only some of them fails startup with an error naming the missing vars.

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_KEY_PATH` | Path to your APNs auth key `.p8` file. |
| `APPLE_KEY_ID` | APNs key ID from developer.apple.com. |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer team ID. |
| `APPLE_APNS_TOPIC` | Bundle ID of the sideloaded Apollo build (e.g. `com.you.Leto`). Used as `apns-topic` on every push. **Must not be `com.christianselig.Apollo`** — see [Before you start](#before-you-start). |

## Optional environment variables

| Var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_APNS_SANDBOX` | unset | Set to `true` to override Apollo's `sandbox=false` registrations and route pushes through `api.sandbox.push.apple.com`. Required for sideloaded builds signed under a dev cert. Ignored in Bark-only mode. |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI`, `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | unset | Fallback OAuth credentials used when the tweak fails to inject them per-account at registration time. Single-tenant deployments can set these and skip per-account configuration entirely. |
| `REGISTRATION_SECRET` | unset | If set, registration endpoints require `X-Registration-Token: <value>`. Off by default for local/private-network use. |
| `STATSD_URL` | unset | If set, emits metrics to the given UDP endpoint. If unset, all metrics no-op. |
| `ENV` | `development` | Tags logs and (when present) the statsd `env:` tag. |
| `PORT` | `4000` | API HTTP port. |
| `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` / `OTEL_*` | unset | OpenTelemetry tracing via Honeycomb's launcher; no-op when unset. |

> [!TIP]
> Quiet the OTLP exporter's reconnect spam in local dev by exporting `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` and `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none`.

## Pointing the tweak at your instance

In the tweak (Apollo on-device): **Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend**.

| Tweak field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Backend URL** | `https://your-backend.example.com` (or `http://10.0.0.5:4000` for LAN). Leave empty to keep notifications silently dropped. |
| **Registration Token** | Same value as your backend's `REGISTRATION_SECRET`. Leave empty if you didn't set one. |

Tap **Test Connection** to verify the tweak can reach `GET /v1/health`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/IMG_4296.jpg" width="300"
       alt="Apollo Settings > Custom API > Notification Backend, showing the Backend URL and Registration Token fields and the Test Connection button">
</p>

Make sure the **Reddit API Key**, **Redirect URI**, and **User Agent** in the tweak's main Custom API screen are filled in for the bundle ID you signed with — Reddit's API rules want a UA shaped like `ios:com.you.Leto:v1.0 (by /u/yourname)`. The tweak attempts to inject these into registration bodies; if injection fails, the backend falls back to the matching `REDDIT_*` env vars (see above). Either path works.

Installed-app Reddit credentials are accepted — just leave the **Reddit API Secret** field blank in the tweak.

What the tweak does once the URL is set: it intercepts any request Apollo makes to the three dead legacy hosts (`apollopushserver.xyz`, `beta.apollonotifications.com`, `apolloreq.com`) and rewrites the scheme/host/port to your backend. The receipt-bypass module also intercepts Apollo's StoreKit receipt read so the per-account inbox-notifications toggle works on sideloaded builds (which have no App Store receipt). Everything else (path, query, method, other headers, payload) passes through unchanged.

## Verifying end-to-end

After the toggle, walk through this checklist:

```bash
# 1. Device row created with sandbox=true
docker compose exec postgres psql -U apollo -d apollo -c \
  "SELECT id, sandbox, apns_token FROM devices ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;"

# 2. Account registered, associated with device, inbox_notifiable=true
docker compose exec postgres psql -U apollo -d apollo -c "
  SELECT a.username, a.check_count, a.last_message_id, da.inbox_notifiable
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN devices_accounts da ON da.account_id = a.id;"

# 3. Test push delivered
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/device/<apns-token>/test/post_reply
# Expect: 200 and a push on the phone.
```

The first inbox message after registration won't trigger a notification — the worker's warmup logic at `internal/worker/notifications.go:274` silently sets `last_message_id` and `check_count=1` on the first poll. The second message and onward push normally. If you want to skip warmup, run:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U apollo -d apollo -c \
  "UPDATE accounts SET check_count = 1 WHERE username = '<yours>';"
```

## Architecture

Three cobra subcommands of the single `apollo` binary, each typically run as its own container:

- `apollo api` — Gorilla mux HTTP server. Routes in `internal/api/api.go`. Device + account registration, notification preference toggles, watcher CRUD, test pushes.
- `apollo scheduler` — single-instance ticker. Every 5s claims-and-reschedules due accounts/subreddits/users with `UPDATE … SET next_check_at = $next WHERE id IN (SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT N) RETURNING id` and publishes the IDs onto rmq queues.
- `apollo worker --queue <name> --consumers <n>` — consumes one rmq queue. Queue names: `live-activities`, `notifications`, `stuck-notifications`, `subreddits`, `trending`, `users`.

Two Redis instances on purpose: one for rmq queues (`noeviction`), one for short-lived `SET key NX EX` dedup locks consulted by a Lua script the scheduler loads at startup.

Every process serves pprof on `localhost:6060`; the scheduler also serves `:8080` for health.

More detail: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Database

Schema lives in `migrations/` (`golang-migrate`). The consolidated authoritative schema is [`docs/schema.sql`](docs/schema.sql); the docker-compose `migrate` service loads that file rather than walking the step migrations (000006 and 000008 both create the same index, so a clean `migrate up` fails).

To run repository tests against a real Postgres locally:

```bash
make test-setup    # runs migrations against $DATABASE_URL
make test
```

Tests that need Postgres skip themselves when `DATABASE_URL` is unset.

## Development

```bash
make build         # ./apollo binary
make test          # go test -race -timeout 1s ./...
make lint          # golangci-lint
```

## Troubleshooting

Non-obvious failure modes encountered while bringing this up end-to-end:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `403 "blocked by network security"` HTML on every Reddit call | UA contains `com.christianselig.Apollo` | Re-sign with your own bundle ID |
| `403 "blocked by network security"` on `/api/v1/access_token` only | `?raw_json=1` triggers Fastly WAF on the token endpoint | Already fixed in this fork |
| `failed to refresh tokens: Post …: EOF` from Go's stdlib | Reddit also rejects Go's TLS fingerprint *if* the request shape is wrong. Almost always a downstream symptom of the bundle ID or raw_json issues, not a real TLS-layer block. | Fix the real cause; don't go down the utls / tls-client / curl-shellout rabbit hole. |
| `BadDeviceToken` from APNs | Sandbox/production mismatch | Set `APPLE_APNS_SANDBOX=true` |
| `value too long for type character varying(64)` | DB predates the JWT migration | `migrate up` or apply `migrations/000012_*.up.sql` |
| `failed to fetch user info: oauth revoked` immediately after a successful token refresh | UA missing `(by /u/<name>)` — `oauth.reddit.com` enforces Reddit's UA convention more strictly than `www.reddit.com` does | Use a UA like `ios:com.you.Leto:v1.0 (by /u/yourname)` |
